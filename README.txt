Project Description:
This project is a Slider Puzzle Game for the Android Platform. The objective of the game is to rearrange the numbered-tiles so that they're in order, from 1 to 8 with the blank tile at the very end. To play, the user simply clicks on a non-empty tile that they would like to move which must be adjacent to the "empty" tile and the tiles will swap locations.

Note: Since the puzzles are randomly generated, some of the formations may be impossible to solve.
